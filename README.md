# Battleships

This is based on the classic boardgame of the same name. The player will challenge the computer in a head to head game and whoever destoy their opponents fleet wins.

Players must place their ships manually on the game board, the computers game board is automatically created and hidden from the player. 

When all boards are ready the battle begins, a players guesses board is displayed showing their previous guesses and the players board is also shown.

The ste is created using Python and displays the skills i have learnt during the Pythonmodule.
